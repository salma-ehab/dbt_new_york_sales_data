# Project Overview

This project involves a multi-step process aimed at loading, transforming and analyzing data using Snowflake and dbt. The key stages include loading raw data, cleansing it, establishing a star schema, and executing queries.

## Loading Data through Snowflake

**Databases Creation:**
- Two databases were created within Snowflakeâ€”one for raw data and another for analytics.

**Data Loading:**
- A storage integration object was crafted to facilitate loading raw data from an S3 bucket.
- Two file formats were designed for 2016 sale files and 2017/2018 files, addressing issues like data trimming and handling commas within fields.
- Distinct format adjustments were applied. For the 2016 format, 22 lines were removed, serving as headers. In contrast, the 2017/2018 format omitted 20 lines and introduced a specific date format.
- A stage was established to copy raw data from the S3 bucket to a table in the raw database. The `sale_year` column was updated after loading each file to reflect the source year.

## Data Cleansing and Preparation

- The meticulous data cleansing process aimed to ensure uniformity and resolve various issues, including null values, data type alterations, and removal of commas and other characters from numerical fields. Additionally, more fields were added to enhance the dataset's comprehensibility.

### Column Details

- **borough_name**
  - No data cleansing was required for that field.

- **borough_code**
  - No data cleansing was required for that field.

- **neighborhood**
  - No data cleansing was required for that field.

- **building_class_category**
  - No data cleansing was required for that field.

- **tax_class_at_present**
  - Transformed tax classes at present to only include the main class and do not encompass any subclasses.
  - Also, replaced any null values with a descriptive string 'Unknown'.

- **tax_subclass_at_present**
  - Added tax subclass at present field to encompass both the main class and its associated subclass.
  - Also, replaced any null values with a descriptive string 'Unknown'.

- **block**
  - No data cleansing was required for that field.

  - Replaced any null values with a descriptive string 'Unknown'.

- **address**
  - Updated addresses by relocating apartment numbers from the address field to incorporate them into the apartment number field.

- **apartment_number**
  - The apartment numbers now include those that were initially within the address field but were not originally assigned to their designated column.
  - Also, replaced any null values with a descriptive string 'Not Applicable'.

- **zip_code**
  - Since there are no valid zero zip codes in the USA, they have been substituted with the descriptive string 'Unknown,' as well as any null values.

  - This field was extracted from the sale_date field.

- **sale_quarter**
  - This field was extracted from the sale_date field.

- **sale_year**
  - Cleansing wasn't necessary for that field since the source year of the data aligns with the year value indicated in the sale_date field.

### Observations in Data Formats

The 2018 format, being devoid of dashes, served as a benchmark. 

In this format, it was observed that fields related to units and square feets were null when certain dimensions, 
like the building_class_column, were also null. Despite this, instances occurred where residential and commercial 
units equaled zero while total units did not. Furthermore, there were situations where all units were registered 
as zero, yet the land square feet were not. 

To address these variations, a decision was made to assign null values 
to all units and feets when fields like building_class were null. This adjustment was considered necessary upon 
recognizing a pattern in the 2016 format, where, in the absence of data in that column, all units and square feets 
were represented as dashes. While in the 2017 format, units were zeros, and square feets were represented as dashes.

## Star Schema 

The star schema is composed of the following key elements:

### Sales Fact Table

Every row in this fact table signifies a sales transaction associated with a building. The attributes encompassed by this fact table are:
- sales_price
- residential_units 
- commercial_units
- total_units
- land_square_feet
- gross_square_feet
- address
- apartment_number
- location_key
- property_specs_at_sale_key
- property_specs_at_present_key
- date_key

The address and apartment number fields have been incorporated as degenerate dimensions, 
serving as descriptive fields. These fields are not employed for grouping or filtering, 
and adding them to any dimension would only lead to an increase in its size.

### Location Dimension

This dimension contains details related to location and comprises the following attributes:
- borough_name
- borough_code 
- neighborhood 
- block
- lot
- zip_code
- location_key

While the addition of block, lot, and zip_code results in a greater number of rows within this dimension, 
their incorporation was motivated by the recognition that these attributes might be utilized for grouping and filtering 
in future analyses. 

### Property Specs at Sale Dimension

This dimension encompasses building properties, excluding those pertaining to the present. The attributes encompassed are:
- building_class_category
- building_class_at_time_of_sale 
- tax_class_at_time_of_sale
- easement
- year_built
- decade_built
- property_specs_at_sale_key

It is crucial to maintain a separation between present and at sale properties as combining them 
would inevitably result in a higher row count.

### Property Specs at Present Dimension

This dimension encompasses only those building properties that are pertinent to the present. These attributes are:
- building_class_at_present
- tax_class_at_present
- tax_subclass_at_present
- property_specs_at_present_key

The present values shouldn't be considered as slowly changing dimensions since they only change once with each 
sale occurrence. Thus, it is suitable to include them as dimensions associated with the sales fact table, 
given that these values experience changes solely in correlation with each sale.

### Date Dimension

This dimension contains all information related to sale dates and spans from '2016-01-01' to '2019-01-01'. The attributes encompassed are:
- date_value
- year_value
- month_value
- day_value
- quarter_value
- date_key

## Analytics 

Multiple queries were run to conduct analyses on the data.

### Query 1:
- This query is designed to compute the average sale price for each borough.

### Query 2:
- This query is designed to identify the neighborhood with the most total units.

### Query 3:
- This query aims to determine the building class category with the highest average land square feet.

### Query 4:
- This query involved tallying the number of buildings based on various dimensions. 

- This entailed counting buildings in each neighborhood, borough, and block, 
  and subsequently combining all the data through a union operation.

- It was noted that multiple records for the same building may exist due to occasional missing or 
  incorrectly entered zip codes. To ensure the unique identification of buildings in such instances, 
  distinctive combinations of borough, neighborhood, block, and lot were chosen.

### Query 5:
- This query entailed calculating cumulative sales figures across different date intervals.

- The analysis was conducted on a yearly, monthly, and quarterly basis, avoiding daily breakdowns to 
  enhance result readability. Subsequently, the data was consolidated using a union operation.

### Query 6:
- This query involved  grouping the data by the current tax class and the tax class at the time of sale, 
  followed by comparing the average sale prices for each combination, determining whether they were greater, lesser, or equal. 

- The unknown class category was excluded due to its status as a missing data value.
